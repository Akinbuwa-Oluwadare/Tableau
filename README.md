# Tableau visualization project.
For this project, I will be using the English premier league datas to visualized basically all the things that has happened in this league before the corona outbreak. So matches played after the corona break are excluded.

# Overview

The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal. 

The deal was worth around £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. Every season, 20 different teams competes for this title with all they have from the 38 game matches.

Manchester united football club is the only team with the highest premier league title as a result of winning this title for thirteen (13) different times. 
This project will be looking at the overall performance of teams competing for this league title for the 2019 - 2020 season using different approaches and draw conclusion with the assistance of Tableau.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this was sourced from Kaggle and the link to the dataset is pasted at the bottom of this readme.
This dataset is a csv file and it comprises of different columns like Teamid, Matchtime, Matchday e.t.c 
For the sake of this project, this dataset was further cleaned and reshaped to a more comprehensive csv with pandas where some columns were dropped, date was converted,splitted and assigned into different column and saved as Premier_league_2009_2020.csv.
This dataset was uploaded to Tableau for visualization.

# Visualization
Slide 1 -- This first slide shows the performance of teams using the amount of wins and total points.

Slide 2 -- Checking the referees with most goals.

Slide 3 -- Total goals scored by teams and the number of goals conceded before the corona break.

Slide 4 -- Boxplot of average goals conceded and average goals scored by each team in a match. A tableau dashboard was created for this so as to place the results side by side and make the visualization more visible and comparable.

Slide 5 -- Total goals scored when a referee is officiating a game. 

Slide 6 -- Weekday with the highest wins, losses and draws.

Slide 7 -- Goals scored,wins and Draws in each month.
